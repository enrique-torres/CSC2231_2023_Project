# BrainCrunch - Heuristically finding optimal mantissa bitlengths for neural networks
## Project repository for the CSC2231 2023 course project
This repository contains the code for the course project I completed for the CSC2231 2023 course.

The project consists of a method that heuristically and automatically finds the optimal inference bitlengths for the mantissas of each layer's weights of any network, post-training.

To achieve this, the project is based on Python and uses the following packages
- PyTorch
- torchinfo
